note to self: the ./target/ dir in this `pwd` (as opposed to ../ aka workspace root dir) is created by:
/home/user/.vim/bundle/ale/ale_linters/rust/rls.vim
somehow! I can't reproduce it manually, I tried.
but setting
let g:ale_linters = {'rust': ['rls']}
in ~/.vimrc
is enough
which is replacing the current:
let g:ale_linters = {'rust': ['rls', 'rustfmt', 'cargo']}
