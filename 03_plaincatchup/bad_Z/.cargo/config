#
#<sebk> howaboutsynergy: you can create a .cargo/config in the directory you are working in
#<sebk> it overrides ~/.cargo/config
#<sebk> or set RUSTFLAGS="-Z treat-err-as-bug=0" cargo build â€¦

# ^ thanks sebk on #rust-beginners freenode irc, it works with RUSTFLAGS env. var only! because ~/.cargo/config flags are appended after .cargo/config ones!

[target.'cfg(any(windows, unix))']
rustflags = ["-C", "target-cpu=native"
, "-Z", "treat-err-as-bug=1000"  #ok this is overriden by ~/.cargo/config because that one's appended last
#XXX: ok `-Z treat-err-as-bug=1` is bad https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27189#issuecomment-512126528
