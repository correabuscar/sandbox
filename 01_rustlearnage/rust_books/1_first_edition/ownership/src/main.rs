    //The lifetime named static is a special lifetime. It signals that something has the lifetime

    static FOO: i32 = 5;
    let _x: &'static i32 = &FOO;

    //To fix this, we can have add_one give ownership back when it's done with the box:
    num
        // "we return a(the same?u mean) box, and so the ownership is transferred back to y in main."
        //"We only have ownership for the duration of our function before giving it back. "
}


//This function borrows an i32 from its caller, and then increments it. When the function is over, and num goes out of scope, the borrow is over.
