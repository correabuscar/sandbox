can't conditionally compile stuff in build.rs
by using feature(s) because then you can't use cargo arg '--all-features'
AND exclude the feature that you only intended to use on build.rs

Say you have a feature called "test_build_rs" which will successfully end with
a non-zero exit on success, to prevent continuation of compilation of the rest
of the crate.
Now you can't use say: cargo test --all-features
As a workaround: you'd have to specify each feature like --features="one,two,three"
and thus make sure it's all from Cargo.toml except the "test_build_rs" one!
