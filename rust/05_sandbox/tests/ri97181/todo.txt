I'm stuck on:
needing to get the prev. panic behavior which would run my own hook (eg. rustc 1.71.0-nightly (a2b1646c5 2023-05-25) )
else it's breaking the test harness and you won't know which test did it.

only then can progress on main patch that tries to workaround the issue of
tests calling exit() and test harness not getting it.
