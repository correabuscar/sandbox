this is from: https://github.com/DanielKeep/rust-parse-generics
it's not on crates.io hence why I had to copy it here to can test it outside
of that project dir

that just shows that it's possible to do, albeit mind numbindly complicated to
write with macro_rules only, instead of proc macros

but the repo itself is a bit outdated and fails with certain enum definitions
like: discriminants (=value) aren't supported it seems.
and there's an error about "record"
