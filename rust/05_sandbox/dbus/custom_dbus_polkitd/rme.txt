doesn't need to run as root anymore, can run as any user!

`cargo run` only works if u have the permission file(that *.conf) for it and place it in /etc/dbus-1/system.d/
else you see:
Error: FDO(AccessDenied("Connection \":1.6\" is not allowed to own the service \"org.freedesktop.ConsoleKit\" due to security policies in the configuration file"))


tested to work with lxqt-leave

sudoers are needed for anyone in wheel group to can execute the shutdown/reboot commands without password prompt and without needing to be root!

files in ./root_drive/ should be in your /  (but with proper permissions, ie. run `visudo -c` to check) and should be root:root owned!
as they are required for this whole thing to work properly
and this `cargo run` rust executable should be running, for lxqt-leave command to work properly and thus to can exit from lxqt via reboot/shutdown options, while you don't have any polkitd installed!
