this exe is supposed to be called as 'diff' or as 'patch' to serve that purpose
and is supposed to be a replacement for the real gnu 'diff' and 'patch' commands
however it won't be fully implementing all that jaz but instead rely on the original commands for the rest of the function

its primary function is to generate and apply only unambiguous patches/hunks!
anything else it would delegate to the originals

superseeds but uses the files from:
../diff/
../patch/

(so don't rename those dirs)


this is pretty much untested, ./g does some bare minimum testing.


this is all such a mess of unhandled cases, no wonder I'm so slow to implement it due to knowing this.
