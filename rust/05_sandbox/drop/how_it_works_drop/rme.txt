all 3 variants are dropped in same order due to hierarchy being:
parent
\- inner1
\- inner2

- no matter when either of the 2(parent vs inners) were created
- and the order of the inner fields creation doesn't matter for their drop
  order, they're dropped in field order, unlike local vars which are dropped
  in reverse order
see: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Drop.html#drop-order
"For structs, it’s the same order that they’re declared: first one, then two. If you’d like to try this yourself, you can modify HasDrop above to contain some data, like an integer, and then use it in the println! inside of Drop. This behavior is guaranteed by the language.

Unlike for structs, local variables are dropped in reverse order:"
