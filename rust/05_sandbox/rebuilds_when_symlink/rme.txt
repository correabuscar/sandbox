this will always rebuild (ie. when `cargo build`) because of the symlink to the exe, which is detected as changed!
happens only when build.rs exists, because:
"In addition to environment variables, the build script’s current directory is the source directory of the build script’s package."

workaround:
the exclude line in Cargo.tml!
