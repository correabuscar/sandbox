so this uses another thread, and counts on main to tell the deadlock-detecting thread that main is still alive
it's more like a watchdog thread
also main must tell the thread to exit when done

not ideal at all because it uses heap allocation (Arc) and starts another thread when I'm unsure if we can do that (ie. is this a fork?)
