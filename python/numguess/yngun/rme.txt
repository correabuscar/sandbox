yes/no guess user's number = yngun (aka magic numbers)
ask N yes/no -only, user questions, to find out user's number in range from 1 to 2^N
that works well on paper.

I suppose a simpler way for computer to do it would be to ask the 10 questions
for binary search purposes, like is your number bigger(or: smaller or equal)
than (2^N)/2 then repeat for the remaining range div 2, so on... 
it would still be N questions(wouldn't it? unsure, maybe +1) 'til found.
