hook X function XRRSetCrtcGamma, to see which program uses it and
thus changes the gamma!

LD_PRELOAD won't work if the binary is suid root, tested on prog1 !
startx is non-suid for me!
yes this works:

LD_PRELOAD=/home/user/sandbox/c/hook/m1_2X/libprog2.so startx

now anyprogram that I run inside X whill dump stacktraces whenever
XRRSetCrtcGamma is called from within that program!
