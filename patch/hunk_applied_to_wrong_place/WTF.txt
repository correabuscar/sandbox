i goofed here, somehow the original workspace.rs already was patched, so had the hunk is the right place,
therefore applying the patch (ie. for the second time), put the hunk in a different place,
but then that's not a problem really, I goofed by having had the patch already applied,
if it's not already applied, the hunk is applied in the right place!
