* count time it took to recompile and show it in either INFO on normal output
* maybe checksum the source files too? and remember their size too ? currently only checks mtime (if i remember correctly) and this mtime isn't even stored(right?)
//* detect if hardlink and only then replace it -- hmm, wait, this has to be done before compiling it, otherwise hardlinkness cannot be detected
//* if different name eg. "moo" than the original exe, what? do we still replace it? or just ask? or neither(currently just showing msg)
* maybe only replace the original exe(but not renamed or hardlinked ones), so if symlinks exist they can still work, but if hardlinks then nothing should get recompiled/replaced (but maybe just warn that hardlink(or renamed exe) is out of date)
