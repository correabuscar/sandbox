<howaboutsynergy> is there something else that I could use to choose only one implementation of something?
(else other than features I meant)
<howaboutsynergy> for example, suppose I have 3 ways to generate random unique IDs and I want to choose only one of them, at compile time
danieldg> the other way is to make your type a generic (like HashMap is from the std library)

use one of the libs:
ctrlc
graceful (last update 3years ago)
signal
signal-hook

to exit gracefully
